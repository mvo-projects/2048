# 2048

### Installation

My 2048 requires OpenGL/GLUT librairies.

Install the dependencies.

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install binutils-gold
```

Clone the project, then :
```sh
$ make
```

### The Goal
Join the numbers and get to the 2048 tile!
How to play ? Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one!

### Options
Feel free to click on the "Autorun" button when you are stuck.
